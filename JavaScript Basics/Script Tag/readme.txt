Script Tag is basically where JavaScript is introduced into a HTML Document.
The syntax of script tag is <script> ... </script>


For embedding an external js file into html code, 
<script type-"text/javascript" src="myScript.js"></script>

src which is the source attribute where we need to mention the name of the javascript file.
