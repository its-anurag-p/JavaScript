this is a html-css code for the browser console to display: "hello world" 
you can use external referencing for a js file which should be in the same directory as the html file or 
use the method shown here to have html-css code in one file.

here, under the script tag usage we have commanded the console to display "hello world" message.

If you are using the chrome browser after opening the html-css document file with browser go to (3 vertical dots on top rhs) options> more tools> developer tools> console> ...which will diplay the output.
