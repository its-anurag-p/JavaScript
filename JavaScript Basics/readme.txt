Visual Studio code or Atom (Text Editor) can be used. 

If you have a lot of JavaScript, prefer to have it on an external reference file method.
If you have a little bit, then you can do it internally.

The extension for javascript is .js

Using chrome browser:
developer tools for chrome: 1> launch chrome
                            2> go to options ( top rhs side )
                            3> select more tools
                            4> go to developer tools
                            
Under developer tools you will find the folowing:

console: It displays the resultant output.
source: It mentions the source files thoroughly with the internal code.
